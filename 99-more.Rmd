# Final notes 

## Other learning algorithms

### Semi-supervised learning {-}

The idea behind semi-supervised learning is to use labelled
observations to guide the determination of relevant structure in the
unlabelled data. The figures below described the *phenoDisco*
algorithm described
in
[Breckels *et al.* (2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23523639).

### Deep learning in R {-}

This book focuses on introductory material in R. This shouldn't
however give the impression that more modern approaches are not
available. R has plenty of activity arounds deep learning such as, for
example, the `r CRANpkg("keras")` package, an interface
to [Keras](https://keras.io), a high-level neural networks API.

See [this blog](https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/09/05/keras-for-r/) for
an introduction.

## Model performance

When investigating multi-class problems, it is good to consider
additional performance metrics and to inspect the confusion matrices
in more details, to look if some classes suffer from greater
mis-classification rates.

Models accuracy can also evaluated using the F1 score, where $F1 = 2 ~
\frac{precision \times recall}{precision + recall}$, calculated as the
harmonic mean of the precision ($precision = \frac{tp}{tp+fp}$, a
measure of *exactness* -- returned output is a relevant result) and
recall ($recall=\frac{tp}{tp+fn}$, a measure of *completeness* --
indicating how much was missed from the output). What we are aiming
for are high generalisation accuracy, i.e high $F1$, indicating that
the marker proteins in the test data set are consistently and
correctly assigned by the algorithms.

For a multi-class problem, the macro F1 (mean of class F1s) can be
used.

## Credit and acknowledgements

Many parts of this course have been influenced by the
DataCamp's
[*Machine Learning with R* skill track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/machine-learning),
in particular the *Machine Learning Toolbox* (supervised learning
chapter) and the *Unsupervised Learning in R* (unsupervised learning
chapter) courses.

[Jamie Lendrum](https://github.com/jl5000) has addressed numerous
typos in the first version.

The very hands-on approach has also been influenced by the Software
and Data Carpentry lessons and teaching styles.
